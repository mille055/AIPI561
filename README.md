# AIPI561
Repository for class aipi561: Operationalizing AI

## Project 1: Chatbot for Duke Radiology Residents
Resource for our trainees from information from Dukerads.com website (protocols, who to call for procedures, departmental policies) as well as user manuals for our main software (Visage image viewer and Powerscribe dictation system).  Will make use of an open-source LLM (LLama-3 8B Instruct), a Pinecone vector database, and a user-friendly frontend.
